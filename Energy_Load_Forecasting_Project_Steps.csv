Step,Phase,Task
1,Planning & Setup,"Define project scope and objectives (e.g., forecast next-day hourly electricity demand for a region). Create a new project folder structure and set up a GitHub repo."
2,Environment Setup,"Install required Python packages: pandas, numpy, requests, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras, etc. Create a virtual environment if needed."
3,Data Collection,Set up scripts to fetch hourly load data from ENTSO-E API. Collect historical weather data from Open-Meteo API. Store raw CSV/JSON files.
4,Data Cleaning,Parse and clean the collected datasets. Resample to hourly if needed. Merge weather and load data by timestamp. Handle missing/null values.
5,Feature Engineering,"Create lag features, rolling averages, time-based features (hour, day, weekend, holiday). Normalize or scale the features."
6,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),"Plot time series, heatmaps, seasonal decomposition. Look for trends, seasonality, outliers, and correlations."
7,Baseline Modelling,Build a simple ARIMA or Linear Regression model. Measure basic MAE/RMSE to compare with advanced models later.
8,Machine Learning Models,Train and tune XGBoost or Random Forest regressors using engineered features. Evaluate and compare to baseline.
9,Deep Learning Model (Optional),Build an LSTM model on multivariate input sequences. Use train/test splits with attention to sequence integrity.
10,Model Evaluation,"Compare models using MAE, RMSE, RÂ², and plot predictions vs actuals. Tune hyperparameters if needed."
11,Dashboard / Reporting,"Create a Streamlit or Power BI dashboard to present live forecasts, model insights, and visual comparisons."
12,Documentation & Finalization,Document code with markdown cells or README. Prepare final report or PDF. Upload to GitHub or personal portfolio.
